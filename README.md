# simple_banking_system
This is my learning project from JetBrains Academy, that simulates a simple banking system with primitive behavior. That system allows to create a new bank Account with auto-generated
card number, created using Luhn's Algorithm, and PIN. User can open account, using number and PIN, and perform some operations, as like checking money on the account, making transfer between accounts
and also deleting account. Also, all information about accounts stored in database.
